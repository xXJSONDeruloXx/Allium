# Allium

Allium is a custom launcher for the Miyoo Mini, Miyoo Mini Plus, and Miyoo Mini Flip handheld devices, similar to [OnionOS](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion) and [MiniUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MiniUI).

## Project Goals

The goal of Allium is to replace MainUI (stock UI) with a faster and more user-friendly UI.
- Fast
- Clean, user-friendly UI
- RetroArch (with Netplay, achievements)
- Box art
- Support running on both Miyoo Mini, Miyoo Mini Plus, and Miyoo Mini Flip without changes

2. Download the latest release and extract into your SD card. e.g. `E:/`.

    - Volume indicator
    - Brightness indicator
    - Error toast (e.g. no core found for game)
    - Anti-aliased circles
- WiFi stuff (wifi stuff is deprioritized because I mainly carry a MM without wifi):
    - OTA update
    - Metadata/box art scraper
    - Cloud save sync
    - Seamless netplay from ingame menu

## Development

Allium comes with a simulator that can be used for development. The simulator requires SDL2 to be installed.

### Requirements
1. `make`, `cargo`, `zip`, `clang` (`libclang-dev`)
2. [SDL2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries) (optional, if simulator is not used)
3. [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross): `cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross` (optional, for cross-compilation)

### Architecture
Allium is split into several binaries:
- `alliumd` (daemon that handles launcher/game/menu launching, vol/brightness hotkeys, poweroff)
- `allium-launcher` (main menu, including games, recents, settings)
- `allium-menu` (ingame menu, including guide reader)
- `activity-tracker` (gui for looking at game activity/playtime)
- `screenshot`
- `say` (draws text onto the screen, using Allium's theme settings and exits)
- `show` (draws an image to screen, or darkens the screen and exits)
- `show-hotkeys` (draws a list of hotkeys onto the screen and exits)
- `myctl` (manipulates hardware like volume. This relies on the MM's proprietary libraries.)

Shared code is located in the `common` crate.

### Simulator
There is no simulator for `alliumd` (no UI, only logic).
```
# Run main menu (allium-launcher)
make simulator bin=allium-launcher

# Run ingame menu (allium-menu)
make simulator bin=allium-menu
```

### Building

Running `make` will build Allium and RetroArch, then copy the built and static files into `dist/`.
```
make all
cp -r dist/. <sdcard>
```
